    <h3>SIMPLE CAKE RECIPE</h3>
    <p>This recipe is a great recipe to make a simple choclate cake.
    It uses ingredients that can be found in most kitchen cupboards.
    You just need to gather all the ingredients, put them into a big bowl
    and mix them with a blender or mixer!
    It can also be used to make cupcakes too, if you adjust
    the cooking times as mentioned below.
    Then you can decorate your cake however you'd like to.

    <h3>Utensils:</h3>
      <p>
        While much of the equipment has already been listed, I feel
        the following list is more accurately described as Utensils.
        Honestly, it comes down to semantics, but that is how I feel
        it should be.
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Measuring Cups</li>
          <li>Measuring Spoons</li>
          <li>Wire Whisk or Hand Mixer</li>
          <li>Pam or Equivalent (I use butter or coconut oil in the pan)</li>
          <li>Spatula - to make sure the full portion of cake batter makes it into the oven.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
  </div>

  <div class="oven">
